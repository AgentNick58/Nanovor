Nanovor
=======

For the people that still have the Nanovor Nanoscope,
 have an Updated Version of the Nanoscope Framework that you can download, copy, and paste onto the Nanoscope.

All you have to do is copy the Files from Github TO your Nanoscope. *bam* You have a newer version. 
It also comes with a few new Nanovors and some other stuff. If you have more than one Nanoscope, paste
to all of them, crosslink, and play.
